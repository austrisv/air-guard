# GAISA SARGS R03 SIDE PCB

This pcb acts as a cover for the NDIR CO2 sensor, which may be sensitive to direct sunlight

You need two of these for one airguard
The slot shape on the side accounts for loose interpretations of Espressifs ESP32 DEVKIT C (may be a bit longer than that of the original design)

Version 3 hardware, designed in Kicad 5
